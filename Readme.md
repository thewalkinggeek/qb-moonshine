This Moonshine script was written for a private FiveM RP server using a custom QBCore-based framework.
Was my first go at FiveM Lua scripting and is being released to the public after server shut down.
The script at the time used modded InteractSound, qb-target, and ped_spawner for dependencies.  

InteractSound: https://github.com/preacher131/interactSound
qb-target: https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target
ped_spawner: https://github.com/Fiffers/ped_spawner

The Script includes a custom ymap to hidden moonshine still sites and features a short Quest-style 
progression system for players to unlock a moonshine recipe list that gives the ability to craft
new moonshine flavors with unique buffs and nerfs. Triggers are stored and checked in metadata and 
provide NPC clues via the phone app.
